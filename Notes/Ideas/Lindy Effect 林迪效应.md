 *The longer I'm around, the longer I'll be around*
 
Lindy Effect 是一个源自统计学和概率论的概念，最初由纽约一家名为 Lindy 的百老汇剧院附近的餐厅的常客讨论而得名。这个概念后来被数学家 Benoit Mandelbrot 和经济学家 Nassim Nicholas Taleb 等人推广和发展。它描述了一种现象：对于某些非易腐类事物（如书籍、技术、观念等），其预期寿命与已经存在的时长成正比。换句话说，某样东西存在的时间越长，它的未来预期寿命就越长。

- The longer a non-perishable thing has been around, the longer it will be around. Like the spoon. Not like the human. 
- There is no spoon...unless you're talking about the Lindy Effect. Then there is a spoon—and it will be around for at least another couple million years.
- Things that have been around for a long time (and are non-perishable) are not "aging" like people, but "aging" in reverse.
- The older something valuable is, the more likely it will still be valuable in 100 years.
- This is strongly related to [[Antifragility 反脆弱]].

### Practical Usage
- *Let the cream rise to the top before you take a sip*: I use this when I let the cream of the TV series rise to the top, garnering end-of-year awards before choosing to watch them. ^d5abb0

### Wiki
The Lindy effect is a concept that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.  
Where the Lindy effect applies, mortality rate decreases with time.

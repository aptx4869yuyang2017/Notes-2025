## 02 构建指南针


### 工作观

- 为什么要工作？
- 工作的目的是什么？
- 工作意味着什么？
- 工作和 个人/他人/社会 有什么关系？
- 好的或者有价值的工作是什么？
- 金钱和工作有什么关系？
- 工作和 金钱/成长/成就感有什么关系？

- 参与社会协作的一种方式
- 与社会链接的一种方式，链接人，链接钱，链接信息
- 把个人劳动力/思考转化成金钱/影响力的一种方式
- 能够让我处于心流状态的工作是好工作
- 有成就感当然很好，但是不能以损害健康为代价
- 同事关系也是很重要的一部分，垃圾同事也会让工作价值降低
- 今天看了 [91Act 起死回生](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1EW421w7AM/?spm_id_from=333.880.my_history.page.click&vd_source=6d4ef5f8b8b73d69ea854cb9321a50ac)的故事，突然意识到，能够创造出让别人认可的成果，也是很重要的


### 世界观

• Why are we here?• 我们为什么在这里？
• What is the meaning or purpose of life?• 生命的意义或目的是什么？
• What is the relationship between the individual and others?• 个人与他人之间的关系是什么？
• Where do family, country, and the rest of the world fit in?• 家庭、国家和世界其他地方处于什么位置？
• What is good, and what is evil?• 什么是善，什么是恶？
• Is there a higher power, God, or something transcendent, and if so, what impact does this have on your life?• 是否存在更高的力量、上帝或超越的事物？如果有，这对您的生活有什么影响？
• What is the role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?• 欢乐、悲伤、正义、不公正、爱、和平和冲突在生活中扮演什么角色？


人生的意义是什么？
- 维持物种的存续，好像是基因赋予的任务，但是我却不太想完成了。不那么痛苦的，稍微轻松点度过一生好像变成了我的信条或者说是底线，如果能有更多更丰富的体验就更好了。当然心流体验是最极致的体验，当然是越多越好多多益善。

- 个人与他人之间的关系？
	- 合作产生更高的生产效率，从某种角度来说，链接关系甚至可以变成价值的一部分，比如粉丝数，关注数等等

###  Ideate This

The text encourages embracing ideation to overcome being "stuck" in various areas of life. It emphasizes that ideation involves generating numerous ideas, including wild and crazy ones, to break free from the pressure of finding the perfect solution. 
The key points are:
Embrace Being Stuck: Recognize that everyone gets stuck and needs new ideas to move forward.
Quantity Over Quality: Generate a large number of ideas to increase the chances of finding effective and innovative solutions.
Avoid Premature Judgment: Suspend judgment during the ideation phase to allow creative ideas to emerge.
Multiple Life Paths: Understand that there are many possible fulfilling lives and paths one can take, which is liberating and reduces pressure.
Rediscover Creativity: Reconnect with the natural creativity that might have been suppressed by criticism and societal norms.
The process of ideation is described as exciting and fun, aiming to expand one's capacity for generating solutions. The text advises against falling in love with the first idea and instead encourages exploring multiple ideas to find better, more creative solutions. By embracing these principles, one can design a life with a multitude of fulfilling possibilities.
